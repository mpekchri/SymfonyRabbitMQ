# Documentation
The last version of documentation can be found [here](https://symfonyrabbitmqdoc.herokuapp.com/). Docs are build using MkDocs. In order to modify and/or build the documentation go to docs/ folder and use the commands
provided by the makefile. You may run:

* `make serve-docs` to start a local development server
* `make build-docs` to build a static website, ready to be deployed to heroku, under docs/site/ folder.
